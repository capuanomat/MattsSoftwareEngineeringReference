| <b>Branches</b> |
| View all local branches in package | `git branch -l` |
| View all remote branches in a package | `git branch -r` |
| Create branch  | `git branch <branch_name>` |
| Create and checkout branch | `git checkout -b <branch_name>` |
| Delete local branch | `git branch -d <branch_name>` |
| Delete multiple local branches  | `git branch -d <branch1> <branch2> <branch3> <etc.>` |
| Force delete local branch | `git branch -D <branch_name>`   |
| Force delete multiple local branches | `git branch -D <branch1> <branch2> <branch3> <etc.>`   |
| Delete remote branch | `git push origin --delete <branch_name>` |
| Delete multiple remote branches | `git push origin --delete <branch1> <branch2> <etc.>` |
| Fetch a remote branch and locally track it | `git checkout --track [remotename]/[branch]` (`remotename` is usually `origin`) |
| Push local branch to remote first time| `git push -u origin <branch_name>` |
| Push local branch to remote | `git checkout <branch_name>; git push origin <branch_name>` |
| <b>Fixing Issues & Undoing Changes</b> |
| See entire commit history | `git reflog` |
| Undo a commit but keep changes | `git reset HEAD^` |
| Undo git add (remove from commit environment) | `git reset <file_name>`|
| Resetting\* (Go to any past state for that package) |`git reset --hard HEAD~<num_commits>` |
| Reset HEAD to any past points | `git reset HEAD@{<number,_check_git_reflog_>}` |
| Restore to the previous state of HEAD (\*\*roughly equivalent to `git reset HEAD@{1}` | `git reset ORIG_HEAD` |

## Fleet & Service Management
### Load Shedding
- Useful for CPU-bound services (could probably be for any other bounding resource, however, if it's measurable)
- ...
- When you have plenty of resources left, what is the throughput you want to satisfy? Call this target throughput. E.g. You want to satisfy 1000TPS.
 - As your monitored resource usage increases, you have your transfer that dictates what load percentage you want to allow (target load) as a function of this usage. For instance at 80% CPU usage maybe you only want to allow 50% of the resources through (0.5 target load).
- To avoid the transferFunction being too responsive to sudden changes in resource utilization, we can apply a utilization filter function before the utilisation is passed to the transfer function instead of just using the raw utilization values.
    - This filter function could just be, for example, an average over fixed time periods (like 10 seconds/30 seconds/60 seconds)
- Ideally you can also prioritize requests, meaning when local resources become constrained you can allow higher priority requests but start throttling lower priority requests.
    - For prioritization you uwill sometimes have Priority 0 (top priority, importance means lower Priority #), for which any request is let through. I.e. any request with Priority 0 is let through, but this should be *reserved for exceptional requests*, otherwise it can leave your service vulnerable to brown outs due to resource over-utilization.

### Load Balancing


### Compiled vs Interpreted Languages
From USC CS102 (Week 15, ppt1): https://bytes.usc.edu/cs102/schedule.html
Compiled (Natively):
- Requires code to be converted to the native machine language of the processor in the target system before it can be run
- Like translating a speech to a different language ahead of time so the speaker can just read it
- Faster
- Often allows programmer closer access to the hardware

Interpreted
- Requires an interpreter program on the target system that will interpret the program source code command by command to the native system at run-time
- Like speaking through an interpreter where the speaker waits while the translator interprets
- Better portability to different systems
- Often abstracts HW functionality with built-in libraries (networking, file I/O, math routines, etc.)

Some languages used for web and desktop apps (e.g. Java and Python) will compile their code to an intermediate form: bytecode
- Then an interpreter can execute the bytecode faster than interpreting the high-level language directly
- A new interpreter can be provided for a new device/platform

Languages like C/C++ compile their code directly to a form that can be executed and run on the device.
