# Overview

This document contains all my notes on programmatic implementation and use of AWS services. It also contains all the key references I've come across and found useful while studying AWS.
* The central documentation for all AWS services can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/
The above usually includes at least a "Developer Guide" and an "API Reference". The former will teach you all about the service from scratch. The latter will just contain details abou all the APIs for the service, this is useful if you're looking to do something very specific or looking for a particular detail regarding one of those APIs that you can't find through the central Developer Guide (or through Google). Some services will contain sections beyond these two.



## Python
In Python, you will conduct most of your development and interactions with AWS using a library called boto3. The central, official, reference for boto3 seems to be: https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html
It contains tutorials, code examples for some services, and the "Available Services" section has the documentation for how to use boto3 with every single AWS service.
